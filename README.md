Artificial Intelligence Image Describer:
A full stack project taking in image input, processing it with Google's Gemini, and outputting a text description.

Technologies:
| Backend: Python processing, folder creation, Gemini API, and Flask server bridge to the front end
| Frontend: React (JavaScript) frontend supporting file upload, input validation, and text output
| Ignored: hidden image upload folder, environment (API key), and cached files

To run: 
| clone repo, and enter directory
| install python libraries and start flask server (pip install -r requirements.txt)
| start the frontend server (npm start (when in frontend directory))

Future Improvements:
Interactive chat window to question and learn about the image
